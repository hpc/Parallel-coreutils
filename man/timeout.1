If the command times out, then we exit with status 124,
otherwise the normal exit status of the command is returned.
If no signal is specified, the TERM signal is sent. The TERM signal
will kill processes which do not catch this signal. For other processes,
it may be necessary to use the KILL (9) signal, since this signal cannot
be caught.
