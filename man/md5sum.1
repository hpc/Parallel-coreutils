.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Print or check checksums.
With no FILE, or when FILE is \-, read standard input.
.SS "Msum-specific options (defaults in brackets):"
.TP
\fB\-\-buffer\-size\fR=\fIMBYTES\fR
read/write buffer size [4]
.TP
\fB\-\-check\-tree\fR
print/check hash subtrees to pinpoint corruption
.TP
\fB\-\-direct\-read\fR
enable use of direct I/O for reads
.TP
\fB\-\-double\-buffer\fR
enable use of double buffering during file I/O
.TP
\fB\-\-fadvise\-read\fR
enable use of posix_fadvise during reads
.TP
\fB\-\-hash\-leaf\-size\fR=\fIKBYTES\fR
granularity of hash tree [0]
.TP
\fB\-\-hash\-type\fR=\fITYPE\fR
hash type [MD5], with TYPE one of:
md5 sha1 sha256 sha384 sha512 sha224 crc32
crc32rfc1510 crc24rfc2440
.TP
\fB\-\-length\fR=\fILEN\fR
hash LEN bytes beginning at \fB\-\-offset\fR
(or 0 if \fB\-\-offset\fR not specified)
.TP
\fB\-\-offset\fR=\fIPOS\fR
hash \fB\-\-length\fR bytes beginning at POS
(or to end if \fB\-\-length\fR not specified)
.TP
\fB\-\-read\-stdin\fR
perform a batch of operations read over stdin
in the form 'FILE RANGES' where FILE must be
a URI\-escaped (RFC 3986) file name and RANGES
is zero or more comma\-separated ranges of the
form 'START\-END' for 0 <= START < END
.TP
\fB\-\-split\-size\fR=\fIMBYTES\fR
size to split files for parallelization [0]
.TP
\fB\-\-threads\fR=\fINUMBER\fR
number of OpenMP worker threads to use [4]
.SS "Standard options:"
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-binary\fR
read in binary mode
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-check\fR
read sums from the FILEs and check them
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-text\fR
read in text mode (default)
.SS "The following three options are useful only when verifying checksums:"
.TP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
don't print OK for each successfully verified file
.TP
\fB\-\-status\fR
don't output anything, status code shows success
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-warn\fR
warn about improperly formatted checksum lines
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
When checking, the input should be a former output of this program.
The default mode is to print a line with checksum, a character indicating
type (`*' for binary, ` ' for text), and name for each FILE.
